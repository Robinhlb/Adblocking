# Adblocking
Contains Adblocking Scripts I make and Personally use. 

Last Update: 22/6/25: Updated rules for Roblox and removed a few uneeded rules.
 The Script here is made by me and blocks ad containers, DOMs and other junk like "Subscribe to Premium" buttons on The following websites:

- Youtube
- Youtube Music
- Reddit
- ChatGPT
- Spotify
- Modrinth
- Aternos.Org
- Facebook
- Netflix
- Roblox

The List also tries to Clean UI from the filters Where Possible.

This Filter is made For Ublock origin with the Adblocking Filter Syntax.
